                WAN stands for Wide Area Network, its exact definition is a very broad term, basically covering everything that is bigger than a
                <a class="popupLink" data-target="lanExp">LAN</a>.
                This means that WAN will cover something relatively small: <br>
                Connecting 2 different regions together, to something as big as the internet itself, and even bigger, interplanetary networks, could all count as WAN.</p>
            <p class="">
                The difference between LAN, <a class="tooltipLink" data-target="manExp">MAN</a>...etc. and WAN is that WAN is not restricted to a location.
                This means that you can’t communicate between computers in a WAN through Ethernet cables or wifi, and you can’t differentiate computers by their MAC address.
                To communicate in a WAN, you have to connect through a TCP/IP suite.

                    network technology, is widely used in LANs, MANs, and WANs, because of it balance in speed, reliability, and cost. The ethernet technology defines how all data

                <p>Wireless technologies takes the ethernet standard of transferring frames and packets into a wireless form with the 802.11 standard. There are many iterations of
                    this standard, including the Wi-Fi standards 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and the most recent wireless technology, 802.11ad. Other
                    branches of 802.11 include regional wireless technologies like 802.11j, which is designed for japan specifically, and other specific use cases.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>What most of the 802.11 iterations use is the 2.4ghz radio band. 2.4 ghz is a good balance between range, penetration, and speed. From 802.11ac onwards, the 5.0
                    ghz radio band is also now supported, an increase in radio frequency means an increase in speed, but at a cost of range and penetration. This means that 5ghz is
                    more suitable in either open office spaces, or small houses, where range or penetration are not needed, and possibly even detrimental to security.

                Switches are smart hubs. They are very similar to hubs, however, they actually have processing power and they read the metadata the packet/frame contains. Switches
                can figure out which recipient of a particular is for, and only send the packet down that port. As you can imagine, this heavily reduces network congestion. On the
                topic of network congestion, a factor that influences network congestion is the <a class="popupLink" data-target="comTypeExp">type of communication system used.</a>.

                        <li>And if/when the switch breaks, because there is a single point of failure, it breaks the entire network.</li>

                        <li> This way of measuring speed has the advantages of being easy to calculate, but doesn’t always accurately reflect speed, as different hops can have
                            vastly differing speeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>It deals with routing loops problem by storing how many hops it has currently calculated, and cutting it off when the hop count goes over 15, and
                            storing the distance as infinite.
                        </li>
                        <li> Every 30 seconds, every router that has their routing tables changed sends their entire routing table to everybody else through

                    The most common WAN protocol used now is the broadband protocol, and the
                    standard broadband protocol is DSL , which stands for digital subscriber line. This technology is popular because it allows the use of pre existing telephone
                    lines to transfer data (Caution: DSL is not dial-up, it is much faster and allows for telephone ).

                    The most popular DSL protocol is ADSL, which is, until recently, one of the best ways to connect to the internet for home users. The A in ADSL stands for
                    asymmetric, and it is there because the ADSL standard does not give the same speed and bandwidth for upload and download. Most users will be downloading much
                    more than they will be uploading. Therefore, it seems logical to take some bandwidth from upload speeds, giving them to the download speeds.

                    Another DSL protocol is SDSL: Which just stands for symmetric DSL, and as the name would suggest, it just means that upload bandwidth and download bandwidth are
                    the same. This is less useful for home users, but for specific cases (e.g. servers) that could use the extra upload speed, this would increase performance.

                    The third DSL protocol is VDSL, standing for Very-high-bit-rate DSL, there are many versions of this protocol: VDSL, VDSL2, VDSL2-VPlus: Each version increases
                    speed. However, while this is an improvement on the ADSL protocol, before this standard became widespread, the next standard in this list came along: Optical

                    Ethernet is a widely applicable technology to transmit data over wire. Ethernet is used mainly in LAN networks as a reliable way to transmit data over a short
                    distance. Ethernet is only really used in WAN networks in locations like switches where they only need to travel over a short distance, this is because of the
                    signal degradation that Ethernet wire experiences over medium to long distances.

                    There are two different IP versions currently, the “old” IPv4, which uses a 32 bit address space to store IP’s, resulting in a bit over 4 billion unique IP’s.
                    This is nowhere near enough for each device to have it’s own unique IP. Solutions like NAT (explained above) was used so that an entire LAN will only take up 1

                    IP protocol is a connectionless protocol. This means that there is no need to set up a personal route/connection between you and the
                    destination before you can transmit data. Each packet contains the information that it needs to get to its destination. This results in less extraneous data and
                    infrastructure to be setup before communication can begin.

                    However, this means that IP is not an 100% reliable method of transmitting data. Errors can occur e.g. Packet loss, the data in the payload can
                    be corrupted, packets can get out of order (since its connectionless, every packet is managed independently).

                    This is where TCP comes in. TCP checks each packet with its checksum, reorders the arriving packets into order, and sends a request for the
                    packets it lost or got corrupted. This way TCP makes the transmission reliable.

        UDP is basically TCP/IP without the TCP part. UDP just blasts packets to the receiver

        <p>Subnet masks allow the administrator to arrange ip’s in a way so that there can be multiple smaller LAN networks inside a WAN or MAN.
            The subnet mask itself is a 32 bit binary number that “masks” the actual ip address, this is done by converting the ip address to binary, and then overlaying
            the subnet mask over it. The parts covered by 1are the network addresses, and the parts covered by 0’s are the host addresses.</p>

        <p>
            In the example above, the range of hosts is 256 (0 - 255), and the network range is 256 * 256 * 256 = 16777216.
            One more thing to note is that the first and last host address (0 and 255) are the <a class="tooltipLink" data-target="broadcastExp">broadcast address</a> and the <a
                href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPMulticastAddressing.htm" target="_blank">multicast address</a> respectively. This means the actual number of usable hosts

        Communication systems can be classified as simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex. Simplex communications just means one way communications e.g: a tv remote, data is sent
        from the remote, but the tv never responds with any data. <br>
        Duplex communications means 2 way communications, and both sides can send message to the other at the same
        time. <br>
        Half duplex only allows for communications in one direction at once. The receiver must wait for a “over” message before sending out their own message. 802.11 Wifi is an
        example of half duplex communication.

        Look at the example on the below:<br>
        <p>
            Normally when A needs to go to C, it will use the route through B because 2 (distance from A - B) + 3 (distance from B - C) is smaller than 14 (Distance directly from A
            - C (imagine a satellite connection). This works perfectly fine until the connection between B-C breaks.
            When that connection breaks, A wouldn’t know about it, and still send its packets to B. When B receives it, it knows that the connection between itself and C is broken,
            functionally making the distance to C directly from B infinite. This means that B will try the other route to C, back through A (since 14 + 2 is smaller than infinity),
            thus creating a loop.</p>
