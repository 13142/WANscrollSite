                WAN stands for Wide Area Network, its exact definition is a very broad term, basically covering everything that is bigger than a
                <a class="popupLink" data-target="lanExp">LAN</a>.
                This means that WAN will cover something relatively small: <br>
                Connecting 2 different regions together, to something as big as the internet itself, and even bigger, interplanetary networks, could all count as WAN.</p>
            <p class="">
                The difference between LAN, <a class="tooltipLink" data-target="manExp">MAN</a>...etc. and WAN is that WAN is not restricted to a location.
                This means that you can’t communicate between computers in a WAN through Ethernet cables or wifi, and you can’t differentiate computers by their MAC address.
                To communicate in a WAN, you have to connect through a TCP/IP suite.

                <b>MAN</b> stands for <b>Metropolitan Area Network</b>

                <p>Wired technologies can be used, the most common wired technology is to use ethernet cables. Ethernet is a family of <b>physical and data link layer</b> computer
                    network technology, is widely used in LANs, MANs, and WANs, because of it balance in speed, reliability, and cost. The ethernet technology defines how all data

                <hr>
                <p>Ethernet takes the data and places them inside a frame. The frame will contain both the data being sent, and meta-data about where the the data is being sent to

                <p>Wireless technologies takes the ethernet standard of transferring frames and packets into a wireless form with the 802.11 standard. There are many iterations of
                    this standard, including the Wi-Fi standards 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and the most recent wireless technology, 802.11ad. Other
                    branches of 802.11 include regional wireless technologies like 802.11j, which is designed for japan specifically, and other specific use cases.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>What most of the 802.11 iterations use is the 2.4ghz radio band. 2.4 ghz is a good balance between range, penetration, and speed. From 802.11ac onwards, the 5.0
                    ghz radio band is also now supported, an increase in radio frequency means an increase in speed, but at a cost of range and penetration. This means that 5ghz is
                    more suitable in either open office spaces, or small houses, where range or penetration are not needed, and possibly even detrimental to security.

                receive to everybody, causing network congestion. Switches (explained below) are much more common nowadays.

        A LAN consists of a group of <a class="tooltipLink" data-target="networkDevicesExamples">network capable devices</a> that connects together in a
        <a class="tooltipLink" data-target="smallAreaExamples">relatively small area</a>. Most LANs usually connect to a router that manages the communication between the localized
        LAN network,

        <div class="linedHeader">MAC --> Media Access Control</div>
        MAC addresses are an unique identifier on every network capable product, specifically on the network interface card. It is made up of 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits (6
        bytes), which is a total of 48 bits. E.g. 5B:4D:77:19:F0:BA, this allows for 2^48 combinations ( < 281 trillion). Manufacturers of network cards also try to make sure that
        every product they produce has a unique MAC address.
