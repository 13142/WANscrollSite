         * Updates the Scene to reflect the current state.
         This is the equivalent to Controller.updateScene(scene, immediately).
         The update method calculates the scene's start and end position (based on the trigger element, trigger hook, duration and offset) and checks it against the current scroll position of the container.
         It then updates the current scene state accordingly (or does nothing, if the state is already correct) â€“ Pins will be set to their correct position and tweens will be updated to their correct progress. This means an update doesn't necessarily result in a progress change. The progress event will be fired if the progress has indeed changed between this update and the last.
         NOTE: This method gets called constantly whenever ScrollMagic detects a change. The only application for you is if you change something outside of the realm of ScrollMagic, like moving the trigger or changing tween parameters.

        /**
         Add a tween to the scene.
         If you want to add multiple tweens, add them into a GSAP Timeline object and supply it instead (see example below).

         If the scene has a duration, the tween's duration will be projected to the scroll distance of the scene, meaning its progress will be synced to scrollbar movement.
         For a scene with a duration of 0, the tween will be triggered when scrolling forward past the scene's trigger position and reversed, when scrolling back.
         To gain better understanding, check out the Simple Tweening example.

         Instead of supplying a tween this method can also be used as a shorthand for TweenMax.to() (see example below).

         * @param TweenObject
         A TweenMax, TweenLite, TimelineMax or TimelineLite object that should be animated in the scene. Can also be a Dom Element or Selector, when using direct tween definition (see examples).
         * @param duration
         * A duration for the tween, or tween parameters. If an object containing parameters are supplied, a default duration of 1 will be used.
         * @param params
         * The parameters for the tween
